# String Formatter
I used the slice(method) to extract a portion of a string and return a new string, without modifying the original string. Used the toUpperCase() method to convert a character to uppercase. Used the trim() method to trim the starts and ends of a string. used the + sign to concatenate the string using multiple methods at once.
